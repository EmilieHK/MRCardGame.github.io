## Playing the Game
After successfully starting a game as described in the *Browse Levels* section, the game starts with the setup phase. In the in-game UI you will see the starting *Currency* of 150. Players can use this currency to buy towers, traps and spells in the game. The *Wave* counter will also be visible and currently set to 0 as no wave has started yet. With the start of each wave this counter will increase. Right next to it you can find the *Start next wave* button which upon being pressed, will start the first wave. Lastly, the cross in the top right corner allows you to give up and return to the main menu.

### The Game Board

To start, place the **Board** card firmly within the camera field, preferably on a flat surface. The AR camera will detect the card and display the game board on top of it. The board consists of many components. The castle that is connected to the stone path is your main base of defense. This is the castle you have to protect from the invading enemies. Every time an enemy enters the castle, the castle will take damage depending on the enemy type. The castle's health is displayed above it as a green bar that will grow increasingly red the more damage it takes. The stone path, the castle is connected to, is the walk path of the enemies. They will spawn at the Portal placed opposite of the castle and walk all the way around the woods in the middle along the stone path to reach the castle. But while they are walking toward the castle, they are vulnerable to your attacks. Use this to your advantage to strategically play and place defenses along this path to protect the castle.

### The Setup Phase (Wave 0)
The game always starts in the Setup Phase (Wave 0) and will only start Wave 1 if the *Start next wave* button is clicked. Until then, players have time to set up towers and traps to stop the attackers in the coming waves. How to play each type of defense will be explained in more detail in the upcoming sections. Use this setup time wisely and prepare for the first wave. If you are ready, start the first wave.

### Tower Cards
In order to build towers on the board, players have to place the **Tower** card within the camera field and on a position on the board. Towers can only be built on the game board. When placed correctly, two buttons will appear over the card: *Build Tower* and *Build Trap*. Click on *Build Tower*.

### Trap Cards
In order to build traps on the board, players have to place the **Tower** card within the camera field and on a position on the board. Traps can only be built on the game board. When placed correctly, two buttons will appear over the card: *Build Tower* and *Build Trap*. Click on *Build Trap*.

### Spell Cards
In order to cast spells, players have to place one of the seven different **Spell** cards within the camera field.
